# Red Black Tree Implementation

## This is the start of a red black tree repo.

Currently when running the binary, the program will create a binary tree from pre defined nodes, and print them.

### Printing Format

It will print left nodes with two "|", and right nodes with "|-".
It will also print red nodes red and black nodes white.
